Patience young padawan. The people who know the most about how to help you are also the busiest. Thankfully there are many of us but it may take some time for your question to be answered. Keep trying (and preferably update your request as you try new things and uncover new information) or come back to it once someone responds. This server is here to help people learn and grow. As such, this server will assist walking you through process, but will not just give 'the answer' to schoolwork and/or other types of work. We would rather teach people how to fish. Keeping these things in mind will make it easier to help you and help make members of this server more inclined to work with you on your requests for help. Please remember, everyone here is here on a volunteer basis, and thus any aid rendered is out of server members' generosity and free will.
