Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. Pseudocode is often used as a detailed step in the process of developing a program.

An example of a program to add 2 numbers together and display the total:
```
Start Program
Enter two numbers (A, B)
Add the numbers together
Print the total
End Program```
