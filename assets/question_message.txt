When asking a question please have the following prepared:

include any relevant information, code snippets, and error messages.
If you are asking a SQL question, please also include the type of SQL server you have (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc).
This ensures that all members of the community are able to provide accurate advice in response to your question.

1. A clear description of exactly what you're trying to achieve. Include as much information as you deem relevant.
    a) What IDEs, Versions of what software, Frameworks, Packages, Etc. are all helpful.
    b) Code blocks via \`\`\`\  example code \`\`\` preferred if available.
    c) Screenshots via imgur or other image posting sites if needed

2. A series of steps you've tried and what effect those steps had.

3. Finally be patient. The people who know the most about how to help you are also the busiest.
Thankfully there are many of us but it may take some time for your question to be answered.
Keep trying (and preferably update your request as you try new things and uncover new information)
or come back to it once someone responds.

4. This server is here to help people learn and grow. As such, this server will assist walking you through process,
but will not just give 'the answer' to schoolwork and/or other types of work. We would rather teach people how to fish.

=================
Doing the above and keeping these things in mind will make it easier to help you and help make members of this server
more inclined to work with you on your requests for help. Please remember, everyone here is here on a volunteer basis, and
thus any aid rendered is out of server members' generosity and free will.

If the entry for #2 is "I haven't tried anything/don't know where to start" then
be prepared for us to send you a ton of documentation links that we think may be helpful to you, or ignore you,
depending on how the server members are currently feeling.
