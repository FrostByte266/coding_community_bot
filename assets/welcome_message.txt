Welcome to our server. Please take the time to go through the #readme  and speak up in #if-you-are-new-click-here  to have roles assigned to you. the moderation team goes through regularly and hand bans anyone without a role attached.

For those of you who are above beginner and don't want to be identified because you do not wish to help, please voluntarily leave and make the mod team's life easier. A culture of mentoring, tutoring, and sharing is fostered here, and if you do not wish to even identify what you have some level of proficiency in, this is likely the wrong server for you.

To beginners, please don't be shy about it, a lot of us here would love to help you, and having the roles just makes it easier to assist you at whatever level you may be at, in the categories you are interested in. You may also like to check out #village-of-beginnings  :smiley:  .

Thank you --(From the Moderations team)
